Free Day Event For Allotment Beginners

Having recently taken on an allotment I know first-hand how daunting it is. The internet provides an overwhelming 
amount of information and although advice from other allotment holders is welcome it can be difficult to know
just how to get started and plan for that first year. My site advertises a day event for allotment beginners
addressing what I have found to be the crucial elements of starting up: planning, preparing, starting small and
maintenance. It is aimed at people who may have just taken on an allotment or who are currently on a waiting list 
for one. The site may also attract people interested in applying for an allotment and those with a general 
interest in growing fruit and vegetables.

Existing Features

- Navigation Bar - Features on all four pages of the site, is fully responsive and provides links to the Home,
Speakers, Register and Find Us pages. It is exactly placed with identical styling on each page for ease of
navigation without having to use forward and back buttons. With added text decoration, the user can easily see 
what page they are currenty viewing (underlined). Underline is also displayed when you mouse over a page link to 
enhance UI.

- Website Logo - Positioned top-left of each page and providing a link to the Home page, following this standard
reduces confusion and therfore matches UI to user's expectations. The logo is visually distinct from other
headings and text being styled with a background colour.

- Introductory Paragraph - This clearly and concisely states when and where the event is being held, who the 
event is aimed at and what the event offers. Hyperlinks are included to take the user to the 'Find Us' page should
they require location and/or travel assistance and also to the 'Speakers' page in order for the user to gain insight
into who will be speaking at the event. Both these links encourage the user to interact with the site enhancing UX.
