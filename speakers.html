                <p>Stuart is a retired teacher and has held his allotment for 12 years. He has
                    been
                    the
                    winner
                    of 'Most
                    Productive Category' for 6 of those 12 years and he attributes this to thorough planning.</p>

                <p> Sahera is an established author and leadership coach who cares for her
                    allotment
                    as an
                    escape from her
                    working life. Having inherited her allotment 5 years ago after it had been neglected for some
                    time,
                    she
                    understands the importance of good preperation from the very start.</p>

                <p>David took on a 10 rod plot 6 years ago with grand designs of having the entire
                    plot
                    producing crops
                    within the first year. After pushing himself to the point of nearly giving up he realised the
                    importance
                    of starting small and enjoying it more! He has won 'Best Allotment' for the past 2 years.</p>
